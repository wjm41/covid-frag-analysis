# Library enumeration
*placeholder* - various reaction SMARTS are used to slice-and-dice the moonshot noncovalent and Ugi series molecules. The resultant pieces are exhaustively combined and enumerated to generate a library of Ugi compounds, and a library of noncovalent inhibitors. These libraries were then screened using the graph SNNs from the `graph_snn` directory.
